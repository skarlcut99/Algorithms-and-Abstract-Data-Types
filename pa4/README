List.c - A multi-purpose List ADT that implements a bi-directional queue of ints in the form of a doubly linked list data structure.
            
List.h - Header file for List.c

Graph.c - A Graph ADT that creates adjacency list representations of graphs, which consists of an array of Lists. Each List corresponds to a 
          vertex in the graph and gives the neighbors of that vertex.

Graph.h - Header file for Graph.c

GraphTest.c - A file used solely for testing the Graph ADT.

FindPath.c - Acts as a client module of Graph.c. Takes three command line arguments: the names of an input file and an output file as well as this file
itself. The input and output can be any text file. The input file contains input numbers containing specific data (the graph's order, vertices for
adding edges, and vertices to run BFS and getPath() on) that this file needs to identify and sort out. The output file will contain the graph's
adjacency list (according to the edges created) as well as the distance and shortest possible path for each source/destination vertex pair inputted.

Makefile - Compiles all .c and .h  files listed here and creates executable jar files for FindPath and GraphClient.
